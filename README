Dead But Not Out is a strategical combat game with a fantasy theme.
This was a passion project I implemented while learning game programming!

1) License Information

All (or Part) of the graphic tiles used in this program is the public 
domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles".
Some of the tiles have been modified.

You can find the original tileset at:
http://rltiles.sf.net

Part of the graphic tiles used in this program are taken from
http://rivendell.fortunecity.com/goddess/268/

2) Manual

From the top directory (i.e DBNO) run the command
	python3 run_game.py 
Note that pygame must be installed for the game to run.

Load game has not been implemented yet. 

From “new campaign”, you can start from “The Beginning” and play up until the 
second level. (Only two levels implemented!)
Clicking on “t.s.o.t.c.m” will start The Secret of the Chocolate Milk adventure,
a silly campaign consisting of two scenarios.
